Doer/Make module

Copied exactly from the reprinting in Advanced Forth by AJ Reynolds.
These screens are originally from the Leo Brodie book Thinking Forth.
Implementations for: fig, f79, f83

( probably contains more errors, must find an actual copy of the original book to correct )
- corrected f83 module
- f79 & fig potentially contain errors

screen #23 = forth83
screen #24 = fig forth
screen #25 = mvp forth79

currently not compatible with gforth, planning to port module for ans compatibility

presented in the form of a screen
with upto 16 lines of 64 chars
