NAME
       gforth, gforth-fast, gforthmi - a fast and portable Forth system

SYNOPSIS
       gforth [initialization options] [image-specific options] gforth-fast [initialization options] [image-specific options]

       gforthmi filename [initialization options] [image-specific options]

DESCRIPTION
       GForth is a fast and portable implementation of the Forth programming language. For details read the manual.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       GFORTHPATH contains the search path for source and image files.

       GFORTHD  gives  the  gforth  executable  used  by  gforthmi  for creating the base images. It should be a double indirect
       threaded system.  Default: gforth-ditc.

       GFORTH gives the gforth executable used by gforthmi for computing the relocatable image from the  base  images.  Default:
       gforth.

       GFORTHHIST  gives the location of the history file used by gforth to allow command-line recall. Default: $HOME. (The his‐
       tory file is named .gforth-history).


EXAMPLES
       gforth

       starts the system and goes into interactive mode.

       gforth file1 file2 -e bye

       loads and interprets the files file1 and file2, then exits.

       gforth-fast

       is the same as gforth, except that it does not support accurate backtraces for signals, and is faster by up to  a  factor
       of 2.  Use it for debugged, performance-critical programs such as benchmarks.

       gforthmi asm.fi -m 1M asm.fs

       creates an image asm.fi that has a default dictionary size of 1MB and has the file asm.fs loaded.


OPTIONS
       --help
       -h     Lists the available options, including some not described here (see also the manual).

       --image-file file
       -i file
              Loads the Forth image file instead of the default gforth.fi.

       --path path
       -p path
              Uses path for searching the image file and Forth source code files instead of the default in the environment vari‐
              able GFORTHPATH or the path specified at installation time (typically /usr/local/lib/gforth:.. A path is given  as
              a :-separated list.

       --dictionary-size size
       -m size
              Allocate  size space for the Forth dictionary space instead of using the default specified in the image (typically
              256K). The size specification consists of an integer and a unit (e.g., 4M).  The unit can be one of b  (bytes),  e
              (element size, in this case Cells), k (kilobytes), and M (Megabytes). If no unit is specified, e is used.

       --data-stack-size size
       -d size
              Allocate size space for the data stack instead of using the default specified in the image (typically 16K).

       --return-stack-size size
       -r size
              Allocate size space for the return stack instead of using the default specified in the image (typically 16K).

       --fp-stack-size size
       -f size
              Allocate  size  space  for the floating point stack instead of using the default specified in the image (typically
              16K). In this case the unit specifier e refers to floating point numbers.

       --locals-stack-size size
       -l size
              Allocate size space for the locals stack instead of using the default specified in the image (typically 16K).


       --evaluate forth
       -e forth
              Evaluates the forth code. This option takes only one argument; if you want to evaluate more Forth words, you  have
              to  quote  them  or  use  several -es.  To exit after processing the command line (instead of entering interactive
              mode) append -e bye to the command line. This is an image-specific option of the default image.

FILES
       .../gforth.fi  default Forth image
       *.fi           Forth loadable image
       *.fs           Forth source (sequential)
       *.fb           Forth source (block)
       *.fd           generated with makedoc.fs
       *.i            C include files
       *.ds           documentation source
       *TAGS          etags files
